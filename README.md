# Books app querying

In this project I will study data on the books industry for a new books app.

The data is compiled from tables with information about books, their authors, their publishers, their ratings, and their reviews.

The end goal is to generate a value proposition for a new product.

The main steps of the project will be:
- Loading the data.
- Exploring the data to learn its contents.
- Analyzing the data to extract useful information.
- Drawing conclusions and formulating recommendations.
